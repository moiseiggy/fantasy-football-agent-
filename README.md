üèà Fantasy Football Agent is a production ready multi-agent collaboration framework that enables you to orchestrate many agents to work collaboratively at scale to automate your fantasy football activities. 

----

## Requirements
- `python3.10` or above!
- `$ pip install -U swarms` And, don't forget to install swarms!
- `.env` file with API keys from your providers like `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
-  Set an `.env` Variable with your desired workspace dir: `WORKSPACE_DIR="agent_workspace"` or do it in your terminal with `export WORKSPACE_DIR="agent_workspace"`
-  Finally, `swarms onboarding` to get you started.

## Onboarding
Refer to our documentation for production grade implementation details.

## Install üíª

```bash
$ pip3 install -U swarms
```


## Onboarding

Now that you have downloaded swarms with `pip3 install -U swarms`, we get access to the `CLI`. Get Onboarded with CLI Now with:

```bash
swarms onboarding
```

You can also run this command for help:

```bash
swarms help
```

## `Agent` Class
The `Agent` class is a fundamental component of the Swarms framework, designed to execute tasks autonomously. It fuses llms, tools and long-term memory capabilities to create a full stack agent. The `Agent` class is highly customizable, allowing for fine-grained control over its behavior and interactions.

### `run` Method
The `run` method is the primary entry point for executing tasks with an `Agent` instance. It accepts a task string as the main input task and processes it according to the agent's configuration. And, it can also accept an `img` parameter such as `img="image_filepath.png` to process images if you have a VLM


### Settings and Customization
The `Agent` class offers a range of settings to tailor its behavior to specific needs. Some key settings include:

| Setting | Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agent_name` | The name of the agent. | "DefaultAgent" |
| `system_prompt` | The system prompt to use for the agent. | "Default system prompt." |
| `llm` | The language model to use for processing tasks. | `OpenAIChat` instance |
| `max_loops` | The maximum number of loops to execute for a task. | 1 |
| `autosave` | Enables or disables autosaving of the agent's state. | False |
| `dashboard` | Enables or disables the dashboard for the agent. | False |
| `verbose` | Controls the verbosity of the agent's output. | False |
| `dynamic_temperature_enabled` | Enables or disables dynamic temperature adjustment for the language model. | False |
| `saved_state_path` | The path to save the agent's state. | "agent_state.json" |
| `user_name` | The username associated with the agent. | "default_user" |
| `retry_attempts` | The number of retry attempts for failed tasks. | 1 |
| `context_length` | The maximum length of the context to consider for tasks. | 200000 |
| `return_step_meta` | Controls whether to return step metadata in the output. | False |
| `output_type` | The type of output to return (e.g., "json", "string"). | "string" |
