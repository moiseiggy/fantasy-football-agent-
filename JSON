Your primary goal is to ensure the user receives well-structured JSON outputs that align with the tool's requirements.\n\n    ---\n\n    Here is the format you should always follow for your responses involving tool usage:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n    \"type\": \"function\",\n    \"function\": {\n        \"name\": \"<tool_name>\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n            \"param1\": \"<value1>\",\n            \"param2\": \"<value2>\"\n        }\n    }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Please proceed with your task accordingly.\n\n    ",

                "content": "### Weekly Fantasy Football Performance Report\n\n#### Team Performance Summary\nThis week, the team's total fantasy points were driven primarily by a few standout performances, while several players underperformed or did not contribute significantly. Here\u2019s a breakdown of key players and their contributions:\n\n1. **Derrick Henry**: \n   - **Total Fantasy Points**: 201.50\n   - **Rushing Yards**: 1,052\n   - **Receiving Yards**: 93\n   - **Rushing Carries**: 168\n   - **Analysis**: Henry continues to be a dominant force in the lineup, contributing heavily in both rushing and receiving. His performance is a cornerstone for the team's success.\n\n2. **Garrett Wilson**: \n   - **Total Fantasy Points**: 156.80\n   - **Receiving Yards**: 663\n   - **Receiving Receptions**: 60\n   - **Analysis**: Wilson has emerged as a reliable target, consistently contributing to the team's points. His high reception count is particularly valuable in PPR formats.\n\n3. **Sam Darnold**: \n   - **Total Fantasy Points**: 136.00\n   - **Passing Yards**: 1,900\n   - **Passing TDs**: 17\n   - **Analysis**: Darnold has been effective, showcasing a strong passing game. However, monitor for any potential injury updates.\n\n4. **Jordan Love**: \n   - **Total Fantasy Points**: 119.60\n   - **Passing Yards**: 1,820\n   - **Passing TDs**: 15\n   - **Analysis**: Love has also been productive, but with Darnold performing better, consider his position carefully for the next week.\n\n5. **David Montgomery**: \n   - **Total Fantasy Points**: 126.02\n   - **Rushing Yards**: 488\n   - **Receiving Yards**: 161\n   - **Analysis**: Montgomery is a solid contributor, but his performance could fluctuate based on game script.\n\n6. **Travis Kelce**: \n   - **Total Fantasy Points**: 99.60\n   - **Receiving Yards**: 435\n   - **Analysis**: Kelce remains a top tight end option, but his output is lower than expected. Monitor for any injury concerns.\n\n7. **Eagles D/ST**: \n   - **Total Fantasy Points**: 52.00\n   - **Analysis**: The defense had a decent week but could improve. Consider matchups for the upcoming week.\n\n8. **Underperformers**: \n   - **Players like JuJu Smith-Schuster, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, and Keon Coleman have not contributed significantly**. Their lack of production may necessitate a roster change.\n\n#### Suggested Roster Changes\n1. **Consider Dropping**:\n   - **JuJu Smith-Schuster**: With no points and minimal impact, he can be dropped for a more productive player.\n   - **Jaxon Smith-Njigba**: Similar to JuJu, his lack of contribution makes him expendable.\n   - **Keon Coleman**: No production this week; consider other options.\n\n2. **Potential Additions**:\n   - Look for available players who have shown consistent performance or favorable matchups in the upcoming week. \n   - Consider adding a backup running back or wide receiver who has been trending up in performance.\n\n3. **Monitor Injuries**:\n   - Keep an eye on **Jordan Love** and **Sam Darnold** for any injury updates. If either player is questionable, consider looking for a streaming quarterback option.\n\n4. **Defensive Matchups**:\n   - Evaluate the matchups for the **Eagles D/ST** and **Steelers D/ST**. If either has a tough matchup, consider streaming a different defense.\n\n### Conclusion\nOverall, the team has a strong core with Derrick Henry and Garrett Wilson leading the charge. However, there are opportunities to optimize the roster by removing underperformers and seeking out players with better matchups. Stay vigilant on injury reports and player performance trends for the best chance at success in the upcoming week.",
